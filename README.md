Hi there, I’m Clark Narvas. I am a nerdy 15 year old content creator creating wonderful and mad blogs/videos/podcasts about productivity, technology, studying and all things in between. 🌟

📝 Blogging: Since November 2019, I've blogged over on clarknarvas.com about DeGoogling, improving my life with better habits and getting into a better study routine time for my exams.

🌹 Politics: I've built effective, proven digital campaigns that reach hundreds of people, help candidates stand out from the crowd and win elections (e.g. Cara McDade for SYL Under 19s Officer)

🤝 Branding: I believe strong branding enforces authenticity and authority. I've built my sister's digital branding to emphasise her colourful personality through design (PAWLEAN)

👨‍💻 Websites: I've created and designed many eye-catching and engaging websites for political activism groups and individuals' portfolios.

🎥 Video: My experience in video ranges from 15-minute YouTube videos to social media shorts. I created a launch video for Labour Nexus, a political organisation bringing different Labour Party's traditions together. Within an hour of the post going live, the video had gathered quite a bit of attention, gaining over 100 likes and followers.

🔴 LIVE: I produce PAWLEAN's live show, "Inspiring Figures", where she interviews "the people you should really know about" from all over the world. (And for those eagle-eyed amongst you... yes, there is going to be a Season 3 this year! 👀)
