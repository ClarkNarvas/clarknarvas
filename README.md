**Hi there, I’m Clark Narvas.** I tell stories through content creation, front-end development and design.

**TRUSTED BY BRANDS AND PEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW: Labour and Co-Operative, Sheffield City Council, PAWLEAN**

📝 Blogging: Since November 2019, I've blogged over on clarknarvas.com about DeGoogling, improving my life with better habits and getting into a better study routine time for my exams.

🌹 Politics: I've built effective, proven digital campaigns that reach hundreds of people, help candidates stand out from the crowd and win elections (e.g. Minesh Parekh for City Council, Cara McDade for SYL Under 19s Officer)

🤝 Branding: I believe strong branding enforces authenticity and authority. I've built my sister's digital branding to emphasise her colourful personality through design (PAWLEAN)

👨‍💻 Websites: I've created and designed many eye-catching and engaging websites for political activism groups and individuals' portfolios.

🎥 Video: My experience in video ranges from 15-minute YouTube videos to social media shorts. I created a launch video for Labour Nexus, a political organisation bringing different Labour Party's traditions together. Within an hour of the post going live, the video had gathered quite a bit of attention, gaining over 100 likes and followers.

🔴 LIVE: I produced PAWLEAN's live show, "Inspiring Figures", where she interviews "the people you should really know about" from all over the world.
