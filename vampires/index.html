<h2 style="float:left">What do Vampires look like?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="float:left">Vampires have raggedy burial clothing, red glowing eyes and long blood <br> covered fangs, but that depends on where your looking from. In China <br> they're covered in greenish fur, in Africa they look like a deformed <br>
fire fly and maybe if you're lucky you could find the Vampire Chair. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style> However, if you're going to look at vampires through TV shows. <br> you'll be seeing a handsome man with a long tooth or a beautiful woman with <br>Black Hair.</p>

<br>
<h3 style="float:right;color:white">Mythical Vampires</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="float:right; text-align: right"> Mythical Vampires live only on blood and do not eat human food <br> though sometimes they can sit with their human companion while they're eating.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="float:right;color:white">Real Vampires (Sanguinarian Vampires)</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="float: right; text-align: right">These vampires do require some amounts of blood for their survival but <br> having it only will not keep them alive. They aren't undead, they just have a disease<br> which makes blood vital for their survival.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 style="float: right; color: white">Psi-Vampires</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p style="float: right; text-align: right">Like Real Vampires, these vampires <i>aren't</i> undead.<br> To survive, they need to sip on small amounts of energy from others and eat food.</b>

<h2>How to kill a Vampire?</h2>


<h3 style="color: white">Sunlight</h3>
<p>The easiest way to kill a Vampire is by exposing them to direct sunlight for 10 seconds, <br> While it's one of the most easiest ways you'd need to plan it because <br> Vampires aren't stupid, and they're very and and strong. They know if they go <br> into sunlight they'll burn so try setting up a trap. 

<h3 style="color: white">Wooden Stake</h3>
<p>To kill a vampire using a wooden stake is to strike first, Vampires aren't very good <br> at defending themselves and they can let their guard down easily. </p>

<h3 style="color: white">Using Silver as a way to slow down <br> the healing</h3>
	<p>You cannot directly use silver as a weapon, you can use it to slow the healing process down. <br> To actually kill the Vampire with it you'd need a lot of it. </p>
